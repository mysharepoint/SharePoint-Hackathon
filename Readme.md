## Project Description: Learning with SharePoint Agents 

In my Hackathon project, I’m to develop a solution that summarizes scientific papers, stored as PDFs in a SharePoint document library, using a Copilot Agent. Based on my personal experiences in the field of large language models and artificial intelligence – having collected and analyzed over 150 scientific papers in the past 12 months – I’ve configured a Copilot Agent that transforms complex content into easily understandable summaries. This agent has been an invaluable learning tool for me, acting like a buddy who can quickly explain complex topics. Additionally, I can create more agents for specific tasks, such as comparing different papers. The key is to precisely define the agent’s tasks and set up a prompt accordingly. 

The unique charm of this solution is that any user with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license can implement it without prior knowledge. The agent can be set up via the website with just a few clicks. The key is to clearly define the requirements and integrate them as prompts in the agent’s properties to achieve the desired result. This simple yet extremely helpful solution is not only applicable to scientific papers but also for video transcripts, protocols and many more.
